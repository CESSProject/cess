# Audit Module
This file is the exclusive pallet of cess and the proof of podr2 adaptation

## OverView

The job of this aduit pallet is to process the proof of miner's service file and filling file, and generate random challenges. Call some traits of Sminer pallet to punish miners. Call the trail of file bank pallet to obtain random files or files with problems in handling challenges.

### Terminology

* **random_challenge:** The random time trigger initiates a challenge to the random documents.
The miners need to complete the challenge within a limited time and submit the certificates of
the corresponding documents.

* **deadline:** 		Expiration time of challenge, stored in challenge duration.
* **mu:**				Miner generated challenge related information.
* **sigma:**			Miner generated challenge related information.

### Interface

### Dispatchable Functions

* `submit_challange_prove`   Miner submits challenge certificate.
* `verify_proof`             Consensus submission verification challenge proof results.

### Scenarios

#### Punishment

When the verification result of the miner's certificate is false,or the miner fails to complete the challenge on time, the miner will be punished in both cases. Decide whether to reduce power or space according to the file type of punishment.
