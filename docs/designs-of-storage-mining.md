# Designs of Storage Mining

Audit is the interface about proof of storage, which mainly deals with the proofs submission and verification of the data segments.

## Proofs of idle segments

### Storage items

```
//pool of the proof of replication(PoRep) ready to verify which is generated by idle segment
VerPoolA = StorageDoubleMap<accountid, segment_id, (is_ready, size_type, proof, sealed_cid, rand, block_num)>

//pool of the proof of space time(PoSt) ready to verify which is generated by idle segment
VerPoolB = StorageDoubleMap<accountid, segment_id, (is_ready, size_type, proof, sealed_cid, rand, block_num)>

//pool of PoRep verified which is generated by idle segment
PrePoolA = StorageDoubleMap<accountid, segment_id, (size_type, proof, sealed_cid, block_num)>

//pool of PoSt verified which is generated by idle segment
PrePoolB = StorageDoubleMap<accountid, segment_id, (size_type, proof, sealed_cid, block_num)>

//count the total block height of all idle segments of miner
BlockNumberB = StorageMap<accountid, (block_num, total_num)>
```



### Call functions

- intent_submit: Outputs parameters such as segment-id, random number and other parameters required by miners to generate the PoRep, and submit some proof parameters to the unverified pool in advance.

```
begin with input(sender, size_type, submit_type, peerid, uncid, hash, shardhash):
	1. get segement_id;
	2. get random;
	if(segement_id unused){
		1. store params in <VerPoolA>;
	}
:end
```



- intent_submit_po_st: Outputs parameters such as random number and other parameters required by miners to generate the PoSt, and submit some proof parameters to the unverified pool in advance.

```
begin with input(sender, size_type, submit_type, segment_id):
	1. get random;
	if(segement_id unused){
		1. store params in <VerPoolB>;
	}

:end
```

```
begin with input(sender, peer_id, segment_id, result):
	if(segement_id in <VerPoolA>){
		if(result){
			1. record current block number;
			2. insert params of segment_id in <PrePoolA> and <PrePoolB>;
			3. update <BlockNumberB>;
			4. add storage power;
		}
		1. remove params from <VerPoolA>;
	} 
:end
```



- submit_to_vpb: Submits the PoSt to the unverified pool to verify for scheduler node.

```
begin with input(sender, peer_id, segment_id, proof, sealed_cid):
	if(segement_id in <VerPoolB>){
		1. update params with adding proof and sealed_cid in <VerPoolB>;
	}
:end
```



- verify_in_vpb: Verifies the PoSt from unverified pool, and submit the results.

```
begin with input(sender, peer_id, segment_id, result):
	if(segement_id in <VerPoolB>){

			2. update params of segment_id in <PrePoolB>;
			3. update <BlockNumberB>;

//pool of PoSt verified which is generated by service segment
PrePoolD = StorageDoubleMap<accountid, segment_id, (size_type, proof, sealed_cid, block_num)>

## Scheduler

- check proofs of submission: Called in a 12-hour cycle to check whether the data segment submits the proofs on time and passes the verification.

```
begin with input():
	if(period met){
		for x in <PrePoolB> {
			if(x not submitted during last period){
				1. deduct power;
				2. remove x from <PrePoolB>;
			}
		}
		for x in <PrePoolD> {
			if(x not submitted during last period){
				1. deduct power;
				2. remove x from <PrePoolD>;
			}
		}
	}
:end
```
