## Scheduler Credit Module

The scheduler reputation module is used to record some operations performed by the scheduler in order to maintain 
the chain state, including records of processing files and records of penalties for failing to achieve scheduling goals.
Finally, the system will give a score to the scheduler according to the set algorithm. This score will be used to 
decide validators as part of the R2S consensus.
